Notes:

-Tutorial:

Step 1: Be sure your system language is set to Japanese (Game language can be too)

Step 2: Choose the psv file you want and transfer it to ux0:vitacheat/db on vitashell via FTP or USB

Step 3: Open your Minecraft and enjoy :D

-Advises and Other:

GabrielChan's can crash your game if not changed

The "All Cheats" Cheat is meant to find the cheat you want and move it to your cheat file, doesn't work when moved to db because of cheat overflow
